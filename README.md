This project explores and models customer churn data for a telecommunications company. The main objective is to understand the key drivers of customer churn and to build predictive models that can help identify customers who are likely to leave the service.This will help the organisation improve their services and be able to retain customers.

## Project Overview

In today’s fast-paced and highly competitive telecommunications sector, retaining customers is more important than ever. This project focuses on understanding customer churn—the phenomenon where users terminate their service. By analyzing historical customer data, the goal is to uncover trends and pinpoint the main drivers of churn. These findings will help the company craft targeted strategies to boost customer retention and reduce the rate of churn.
This project includes:

## Business and Data Understanding
The dataset used is available as a file in this repository and it contains the following elements:-
- States
- Phone numbers and area codes
- Total day, evening and night calls, charges and minutes.
- Customer service calls.
- Churn. Whether a customer left or not.
### Some of the methods used to analyse this data are:-
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model building and evaluation
- Insights and recommendations
- 
## Files Included

- `CHURN PROJECT.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook with all code, visualizations, and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `Churn.csv`: The data set

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- 
## Machine Learning Models

The following models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Key Findings
 Through comprehensive data cleaning, exploration, and modeling, we identified key drivers influencing churn, such as frequent customer service calls, international plan usage, and high day-time call activity.

By transforming raw telecom data into actionable insights, this solution empowers the organization to:

- Reduce churn through targeted interventions

- Optimize plan offerings

- Improve overall customer satisfaction

In conclusion, machine learning provides a scalable, data-driven approach to enhancing customer loyalty and reducing revenue loss — critical components for long-term business sustainability in the competitive telecom industry.
